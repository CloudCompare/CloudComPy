PCL is a standard plugin of cloudComPy.
The plugin implements some methods of the Point Cloud Library (PCL): https://pointclouds.org.

The availability of the plugin can be tested with the :py:meth:`cloudComPy.isPluginPCL` function:
::

  isPCL_available = cc.isPluginPCL()

PCL is a submodule of cloudCompy:
::

  import cloudComPy as cc
  # ...
  if cc.isPluginPCL():
      import cloudComPy.PCL
      fgr = cc.PCL.FastGlobalRegistrationFilter()
      fgr.setParameters(...)
      fgr.compute()

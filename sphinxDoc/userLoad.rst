Loading clouds and other entities from files
============================================

Entities known by CloudComPy are mainly PointClouds, triangular meshes, polylines...

CloudComPy can read a lot of formats of point clouds and meshes.
The ``.bin`` binary format is the native format of CloudCompare and can store several entities of all types.
Have a look to the the details of formats handled by CloudCompare on `wiki <https://www.cloudcompare.org/doc/wiki/index.php/FILE_I/O>`_.

For clouds, the extensions known by CloudComPy are:
``.asc`` ``.bin`` ``.drc`` ``.dxf`` ``.E57`` ``.las`` ``.laz`` ``.pcd`` ``.ply`` ``.sbf`` ``.shp`` ``.vtk`` ``.xyz``

For meshes: 
``.dxf`` ``.bin`` ``.fbx``  ``.obj`` ``.off`` ``.ply`` ``.stl`` ``.vtk`` 

For polylines:
``.dxf`` ``.georef`` ``.obj`` ``.poly`` ``.sx`` ``.shp``

Loading a point cloud (from the examples generated by autotests).
::

    cloud = cc.loadPointCloud("~/CloudComPy/Data/dataSample_1.0.xyz")
    
Loading a mesh
::
    
    mesh = cc.loadMesh("~/CloudComPy/Data/mesh.stl")
  
Loading a polyline
::

    poly = cc.LoadPolyline("~/CloudComPy/Data/poly1.poly")
    
    inputFile = os.path.expanduser("~/CloudComPy/Data/dataSample_1.0.xyz")

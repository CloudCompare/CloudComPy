## Build on Linux64, with Docker and Conda

The build procedure is very similar to the [procedure used on Ubuntu with conda](BuildLinuxConda.md), but uses a docker container which provides a better control of the environment.

This procedure has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

You must have [installed docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your computer.

Create a directory (for instance `dockerbuild`) for building the docker image and copy into it the script `genCloudComPy_Conda39_docker.sh`, the Docker file `Dockerfile_CloudComPy39_build_fbxsdk` from the the `building` directory of the CloudComPy repository.

Create also an empty file `noplugin` on docker image build directory (`dockerbuild`):

```
cd dockerbuild
touch noplugin
```
This empty file will be used by the Dockerfile script if you don't want to install the FBX I/O plugin.

If you want the FBX I/O plugin, download the [FBX SDK for Linux](https://www.autodesk.com/content/dam/autodesk/www/adn/fbx/2020-0-1/fbx202001_fbxsdk_linux.tar.gz) from [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0), create a `fbxsdk` directory on the directory for the docker image build and detar completely the sdk into it (two steps, you have to accept the License). 

To build without FBX SDK plugin:

```
cd dockerbuild
docker build -f Dockerfile_CloudComPy39_build_fbxsdk -t cloudcompy39_build .
```
To build with FBX SDK plugin:

```
cd dockerbuild
docker build --build-arg FBXINC=fbxsdk/include --build-arg FBXLIB=fbxsdk/lib -f Dockerfile_CloudComPy39_build_fbxsdk -t cloudcompy39_build .
```

You have to run the docker image to execute the tests and get the binary tar file. Create an empty directory (for instance `~/CloudComPy/result`) on your host to share the results with the docker container.

```
mkdir -p ~/CloudComPy/result
cd ~/CloudComPy/result
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/root/CloudComPy cloudcompy39_build /bin/bash
```

from the container prompt:

```
./execTests.sh
/bin/cp /opt/installConda/CloudComPy_Conda39_Linux64_*.tgz /root/CloudComPy/
```

On your host, on `~/CloudCompy/result`, get the files from the tests and the CloudComPy binary tarfile. This binary can be used in the same way as the linux binary available on the site [simulation.openfields.fr](https://www.simulation.openfields.fr/index.php/download-binaries).

**Remark**: shared results are root, change to current user:

```
cd ~/CloudComPy/result
sudo chown -R `id -nu`:`id -ng` .
```

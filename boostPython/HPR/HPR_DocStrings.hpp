HPR is a standard plugin of cloudComPy.

The availability of the plugin can be tested with the isPluginHPR function:

  isHPR_available = cc.isPluginHPR()

HPR is a submodule of cloudCompy:
::

  import cloudComPy as cc
  # ...
  if cc.isPluginHPR():
      import cloudComPy.HPR
      cc.HPR.computeHPR(...)

Compute Hidden Point Removal for point cloud. (plugin HPR)

The HPR algorithm creates a new cloud in which the hidden points are removed.

:param ccPointCloud cloud: input cloud, with hidden points.
:param ccVector3D viewPoint: view point coordinates

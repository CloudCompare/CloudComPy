Container of in/out parameters for nearest neighbour(s) search.

This structure is generic and can be used in multiple cases.
It is particularly useful when searching nearest neighbours around points
that lie in the same octree cell. In this case, several informations about
this cell should be given to the search algorithm through this structure, but only
once,before the first search. Then the search algorithm can be called multiple times,
and only few informations need to be updated (the query point, etc.).

**Information to set before search**

:ivar tuple queryPoint: Query point coordinates. Should be updated each time.
:ivar int level: Level of subdivision of the octree at which to start the search,
    Should be set once and for all.
:ivar int minNumberOfNeighbors: Minimal number of neighbours to find
    used only during multiple neighbours search (see findNearestNeighborsStartingFromCell).
    This is only indicative and not guaranteed.
:ivar tuple cellPos: Cell position in the octree of the cell including the query point.
    The position is expressed for the level of subdivision at which the search will
    be processed. Use see :py:meth:`getCellPos` to determine this position.
    This information should only be updated if the cell changes.
:ivar tuple cellCenter: Coordinates of the center of the cell including the query point.
    Use DgmOctree::computeCellCenter to determine these coordinates.
    This information should only be updated if the cell changes.
:ivar float maxSearchSquareDistd: Maximum neihgbours distance.
    The NN search process will stop if it reaches this radius even if it
    hasn't find any neighbour (acceleration). To disable this behavior,
    set the maxSearchSquareDistd to something <= 0).

**Information to set to 0 before search**

:ivar list minimalCellsSetToVisit: List of indexes of the cells that
    have been already visited by the algorithm.
    This field is updated by the search algorithm. It should only be emptied
    if the cell that includes the query points change. Only used by the
    "unique nearest point" search algorithm.

    All the points that belong to the cubical neighbourhood of the current cell.
    This structure is only used by the "multiple nearest neighbours" search algorithms.
    The nearest points (relatively to the query point) are stored at the beginning of
    the vector. They are associated to their square distance to the query point.
:ivar int alreadyVisitedNeighbourhoodSize: Size of the cell neighbourhood
    that has been already visited by the algorithm.
    This field is updated by the search algorithm. It should only be reset to 0
    when the cell that includes the query point changes. A value of 0 means that
    no cell has been visited yet, 1 means that only the cell that includes the
    query point has been visited, 2 means that this cell and its 27 neighbourhing
